## Description
**YAGNI - You aren't gonna need it** is a software development principle which arose from [Extreme Programming - XP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_programming) that states the features should only be added when required.

[Extreme Programming - XP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_programming) co-founder [Ron Jeffries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Jeffries) has written *"Always implement things when you actually need them, never when you just foresee that you need them"*.

[John Carmack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Carmack) has written *"It is hard for less experienced developers to appreciate how rarely architecting for future requirements / applications turns out net-positive"*.
