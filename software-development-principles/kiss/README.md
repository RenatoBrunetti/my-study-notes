## Description
**KISS - Keep it simple, stupid** is a design principle noted by the [U.S. Navy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Navy) in 1960. The KISS principle states that most systems work best if they are kept simple rather than made complicated. Wherever possible, complexity should be avoided in a systemâ€”as simplicity guarantees the greatest levels of user acceptance and interaction.
